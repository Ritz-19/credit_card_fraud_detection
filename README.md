# credit_card_fraud_detection
Developed a ensemble learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions as part of the 'Python for Data Science' undergraduate course. This project involved comprehensive data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and dimensionality reduction using a highly unbalanced dataset of European cardholder transactions. By implementing advanced techniques and leveraging PCA-transformed features, the model effectively identifies fraudulent activities, enhancing the security and reliability of credit card transactions.
